# Surfs Up
a weather analysis of a prospective location for a surf shop/ice cream parlor

## Overview
I am an entrepreneur looking to open a surf shop/ice cream parlor. However, in order to be profitable, I would need to do good business year-round. Few places in the USA would permit such a place to remain open all year, but our prospective location in Oahu is one of them. Even so, out of abundance of caution, my financial backer has asked me to use my data analysis tools including sqlalchemy to analyze temperature data for June and December to make sure we can stay open during those months.

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## Results

Here are the summary statistics for the June temperatures.

And here are the summary statistics for the December temperatures.

## Summary

The results show that -- as far as temperature is concerned -- that a year-round business model is sustainable.

While we have good data, we must continue to conduct further analyses. We should also look at precipitation data from the two months. It may be warm, but no one wants to surf and eat ice cream in the rain. We should also look at cloud data; a 70 degree day might be a fine day for surfing and ice cream if it is sunny but unpleasant if it is cloudy. Before we move forward, we should query the database for cloud and rain data.





For this part of the Challenge, write a report that describes the key differences in weather between June and December and two recommendations for further analysis.

The analysis should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
